## Basic voting app

Can signup for account
Can login
Once logged in, user can vote for a candidate
User can only vote once, but user can remove their vote to vote for another candidate

to do for future updates:
carousel candidates display
basic form validation
    - error msg on wrong login
    - error msg on existing username on signup
    - error msg on blank username/password on signup
responsive design for thin width displays
loading component when fetching or running async functions
fix styling for other browsers (works currently on edge, vote form doesnt work on chrome, idk on other browsers)
